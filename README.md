# 🚀 MERN Beginner Project

## 🎯 Overview
The **MERN Beginner Project** is a **beginner-friendly introduction** to full-stack development using **React, Node.js, Express.js, and PostgreSQL**. This project is structured into **three independent modules**, each representing a core technology in modern web development.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **React** – Frontend development for dynamic and interactive user interfaces.  
- **Node.js** – Backend runtime environment for server-side processing.  
- **Express.js** – Lightweight Node.js framework for handling API routes efficiently.  
- **PostgreSQL** – SQL-based relational database system for data persistence.  

## 📂 Project Structure
The repository consists of **three standalone folders**, each demonstrating a core part of a full-stack application:  
1. **React Folder** – Frontend components, state management, and UI logic.  
2. **Node.js + Express Folder** – Backend services, API endpoints, and middleware.  
3. **PostgreSQL Folder** – Database schema, queries, and configurations.  

Each module operates independently, allowing users to explore individual technologies before integrating them.

## 🔍 Features
✅ **Modular Design** – Each technology is implemented separately for a structured learning experience.  
✅ **Beginner-Friendly Approach** – Simplifies concepts for new developers exploring MERN and databases.  
✅ **Standalone Projects** – Each folder is **independently runnable**, making testing and debugging easy.  
✅ **Database Connectivity** – PostgreSQL integration for handling structured data efficiently.
